## Logo Customization

To customize the logo for the Fashion Store application:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory as `logo.png`
2. The recommended dimensions are 120-150px width × 40-50px height
3. Supported format: PNG with transparent background recommended

The logo will automatically appear in:
- The header navigation bar
- The browser favicon/tab icon

If no `logo.png` file is provided, the application will display "FASHION STORE" as text.
